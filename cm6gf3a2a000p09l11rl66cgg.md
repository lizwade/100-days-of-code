Sometimes what you need just lands in your lap. Today at School of Code our homework is to learn all about… forms! We’ve been pointed to some good resources, which I was able to whizz through since it was a recap of what I taught myself at the weekend. Unsurprisingly I went down plenty of rabbit holes regarding client-side validation, server-side validation, and website security in general.

Next it was time to learn about forms in React specifically:

And lastly we had to read about React libraries, and this is where I realised it’s crazy for me to be making components from scratch for my form. Others have made beautiful things, and are giving them away for free! I should just pick one of these and use it.

(Now I’m going to have to watch some tutorials though…)
