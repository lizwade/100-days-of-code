This week has taught me that if you always insist on mastering walking before you can run, you will be too slow. Toddle a bit, then just spin the legs and see how far you can get before you fall over. Learn to take a tumble. I am starting to see that I have been a procrastinator all my life. I didn’t really notice before, because unlike a lot of procrastinators I do have a decent list of achievements to point to, since I also happen to be insanely persistent. But if I forced myself to go faster and take a few more risks, I would not need to rely on my powers of endurance to get results. More to the point, no employer is going to sit around waiting for me to spend two weeks solidifying my understanding of how html forms work, when people like my team mates last week can hack together a full stack website in 24 hours with a framework and three libraries they’ve never used before, with a bit of help from chatGPT. And it works, and looks great, so I can’t even console myself with the myth that speed and quality are inversely correlated.

How to actually adopt this behaviour though? That’s a tricky one. Might take months of research…
