# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday 11 November 2024

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the School of Code pre-work on Javascript functions and developer tools

**Thoughts:** Today I struggled to find the sweet spot between being in and out of my comfort zone. Most of the Javascript basics seem obvious to me, as I once knew Java quite well (I have forgotten much of it, and I know they are different anyway, but the syntax of Javascript is very familiar). But then the developer tools in Chrome were really scary, and that tutorial seemed full of Javascript stuff we haven't covered yet (eg using the consolde to debug listeners, when we haven't even been introduced to them) and I felt a bit cross (unfairly) with the Odin Project people for jumping around like that. Clearly it is up to me to work out how to make the materials work for me: skipping if I don't need them, supplementing when they confuse me - but mostly just getting on with stuff. I need to get over my tendency to be a Very Diligent Student and submit completely to the teacher. My coding today was not pushable stuff so instead I'm linking to the latest commit of the recipe website I've been building.

### Day 2: Tuesday 12 November 2024

**Today's Progress**: Brushed up a bit of Python on Codewars

**Thoughts**: This is probably procrastination, but working with Javascript reminded me how much I enjoy the problem-solving of coding, and how fun it used to be to solve katas on Codewars. Since the Javascript tutorials weren't feeling like fun today, I logged back into Codewars for the first time in years, and decided to try a 5kyu kata in Python (which I taught myself to a beginner-intermediate level in 2020 when I had plans to become a data scientist). The kata was to take a colour specified as RGB and return the 6 digit hex. I'd forgotten the necessary methods in python and had to look them up (how to convert an int to a different base, how to force leading zeroes in a numeric string) but I knew what steps to take to solve the problem, and in the process of implementing a solution I also re-discovered some useful concepts like list comprehension. I spent a while pondering the best way to force the input values inside the range 0-255 (which took me on a pleasing detour back into my dusty Stack Exchange account) and I eventually plumped for the most obvious and slightly longer (but very easy-to-read) implementation over a "cleverer" but cloudier one-line option. I am justifying this diversion into Codewars/Python on the basis that (a) learning by doing is better than letting tutorials wash over you, and even if it's in Python, I am revising fundamental algorithms etc, which will surely be helpful for School of Code, right? (b) It will be good to do katas in javascript once I know enough to get started, and (c) Python is great for back-end development, which is my current tentative hypothesis about where I'd like to focus. Or maybe it <em>is</em> just procrastination!
