I am cleaning up my Mystery Musical Bootcampers code as I whip the app into shape. I’m trying to get rid of all my linting errors and warnings, since I know from last week’s hackathon that even though the program will run with them (at least in dev mode), they cause deployment failure (unless I defeat the safety mechanisms, which I prefer not to do). Most of my warnings are about missing props validation, so I asked co-pilot to explain that to me, and it told me about PropTypes. But this looked a lot like a job for TypeScript? Researching the difference led me to [some heated debate](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/xnw89i/using_proptypes_with_typescript/) on Reddit (TLDR: Since TypeScript only checks at compile-time, and PropTypes checks at run-time but only in development, they are basically equivalent, which means TypeScript effectively replaces the earlier PropTypes and is generally a better bet).

This led me to make the decision to TypeScriptify my entire app. It makes me feel less lost, especially when passing props around. [This fabulous cheatsheet](https://react-typescript-cheatsheet.netlify.app/docs/basic/getting-started/basic_type_example/) shows the various properties (is that the word?) that might appear in an interface for a props object, including different kinds of callback functions, and I think it will help me get all the components talking nicely to each other.
