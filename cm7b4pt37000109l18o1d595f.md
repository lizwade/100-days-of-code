Hovering on the piano keys lets you browse names. Clicking now chooses a name, pushes it up to the App via a callback function, after which it is inserted into the text below the piano. The front end is deployed and works in Chrome, although not in Safari (I need to sort out my pre-flight headers, apparently). The backend is failing deployment, but that’s a problem for another day.

Next steps: implement a lovely toggle radio button for the do / don’t choice, and (the big one) sort out an authentication strategy.
