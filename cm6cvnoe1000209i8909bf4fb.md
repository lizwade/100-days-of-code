Today is Saturday. I started my new passion project: Mystery Musical Bootcamper. The end product will involve a simple guessing game, but the first part just requires a form where boot campers can submit their music. We touched on forms yesterday as part of our React hackathon, but there’s still a lot to learn, especially given I know almost nothing about how inputs and forms work even in ordinary html / javascript. No doubt there are React libraries that handle all this, and perhaps that’s what I should be doing. But much as it’s important not to reinvent the wheel, I also have to learn what I’m doing, so I think it’s legitimate to write it myself. I was questioning whether React was the right tool for something that is basically just a form, but since the game will use it, I think it make sense.

I had already considered that boot campers might not want their full names up on the internet, so I would need to use just their first names. I’d planned to put these in a dropdown menu, to avoid having to validate user-entered text. What I hadn’t considered until I sat down to really start planning it out is that strangers who come across the site could pose as one of the boot campers. Or indeed, boot campers eager to see whether I’ve thought things through might submit rogue entries under other boot campers’ names. Without getting deep into passwords and encryption, I was thinking I can solve this by generating a code for each boot camper and supplying it to them through Slack. It will involve doing some stuff by hand, but not too much. This made me think that actually I might want to pre-record each boot camper in the database, with their code stored against their name (and a unique ID). That way, the code they enter can be checked against the code held against their name, and if it’s correct, the page can render them the form to enter their details. On submission, an API PUT request would update the details in the database. This also means a user could come back and revalidate any time if they wanted to change their data. I guess a GET request could populate the fields with any existing data. And define the values for the dropdown menu of names. We wouldn’t need a POST request, since there won’t be any new boot campers coming along later. Unless POST is just for me, to enter the data in the first place! (I’m not sure how else I‘d get it in there, actually.)

There’s so much to think about, and this is without doing proper authentication, and before I even start on the “how to build a drop down menu in React” tutorial i found. And this is supposed to be my easy project, that I’ve embarked on for a quick win, while I get good enough to tackle the other ones!
