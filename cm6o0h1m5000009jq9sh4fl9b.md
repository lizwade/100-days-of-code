I have a lot of things still to implement to get my project up and running (and these are just the ones that are obvious to me right now).

#2 is probably rather a large task to set as a single ticket. This morning I have finally managed to finish watching the video from the only day of School of Code I’ve missed, nearly a month ago, which happened to be the day that covered creating a database with tables, environment files, setting up postgres… basically all the stuff I want to do now. I have been walking through the workshop from that day, and I have not found it easy. At the time I thought SQL was a doddle, but I have forgotten it all in the intervening weeks. And the task ahead is harder than what we did before: I have to design my own database schema, which means revising Entity Relationship Diagrams and how tables work etc, as well as how they’re created in SQL.

I had been thinking of my database in terms of a single table, where the details of a bootcamper - their name and gender (needed to keep the game fun if vocals are present) and a one-time authorization code - would be entered into a record by me, and then the bootcamper would log in and update their record by adding data to the empty fields eg songName, mp3Url etc. I was thinking this would be achieved by a PATCH request under the hood, and that no POST route would be needed, as there would never be new records created after my initial seeding. But as soon as I sat down to draw an ERD, I realised that there really should be two tables - something like this:

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1738522618325/ff673b23-222c-40ef-be33-5be7abbae6c0.jpeg align="center")

One, called **bootcampers**, will have a record for each bootcamper (whether they are a musician or not). I will enter their name (first name only) and gender. I will let the system generate an ID as a primary key, and a random authentication code which I will distribute by hand (via Slack) to each person. According to [this post](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/93902/is-postgress-uuid-generate-v4-securely-random), the UUID generator built in to postgres is an acceptable way to do this. Once I’ve entered that data, this table should never need to be written to again. But a second table, called **songs**, can hold the song info that a bootcamper will enter themselves. The id of the bootcamper who is the musician for that song would be a foreign key in this table. I thought about using the url of the mp3 as a primary key, since this will be unique (unless two bootcampers have unwittingly collaborated on the same song), but [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5438228/better-to-use-url-long-string-for-primary-key-or-a-shorter-serial-integer-pri) says its better to use integers as primary keys. In fact it says it’s better to use keys that have no meaning other than a row identifier. It also points out that urls for a given resource can change, and as we know, a primary key must never change.

Splitting the data into two tables opens up the possibility of letting one bootcamper submit multiple songs - I went so far as to permit this in my ERD above, with the zero-to-many symbol at the **songs** end of the link between tables. But on reflection, I don’t think that would make for great gameplay, and I’m not sure how I would prevent dozens of entries by one person. So I think I will change the above to 0 or 1 on the right. If I recall, the way to do this is to specify that the Foreign Key must be unique in **songs**. A nice thing about this new design is that when a bootcamper submits a song, they will be making a new row in the table, so I can achieve it with a POST request, which feels cleaner and more appropriate than using PATCH.

I guess this design also makes it relatively easy to add a third table of data relating to the playing of the game (eg games played and scores) which could link to the **bootcamper**s table, since they will be the players. Although that’s not currently in scope!
